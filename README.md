ABOUT ME <br>
I have always been fascinated by various technologies since childhood and dreamed of being a part of this field. I enjoy trying out a variety of things, from web development to analyzing various datasets.
Currently I'm a foundation-level student at IIT Madras pursuing a BS degree in Data Science and Applications. 
In the September term of 2024, I passed my qualifying exam. My overall CGPA till now is 9.67.
